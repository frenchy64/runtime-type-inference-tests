# java.jdbc

Freezes in annotation gen.

# enlive

Freezes in annotation gen.

# data.int-map

Stack overflow in tools.analyzer.

# data.json

- `list?` preservation
- sorted set preservation
- *value-fn* uses pointer equality on functions,
  breaks after wrapping

- only track up to 20 fn arity

- Freezes in annotations gen

# fs

- Stackoverflow in tools.analyzer (?)
  - had to comment out `glob` definition

- infinite annotation generation loop

# data.priority-map

- giant deftype does not compile with tools.analyzer

## Annotations

- Merge defalias's that are just `Long`
  - maybe inline these aliases

- pm-empty-keyfn
  - 1-arity calls 2-arity
  - should share aliases for first arg
    - they're identical anyway

- priority-map-keyfn
  - kw args, homogeneous
  - collapse?

- priority-map-by
  - 1 arg should collapse into kwargs

- MACRO annoation????
  - apply-keyfn


# data.xml

- good experience

## Annotations

- missing defrecord annotation
  - clojure.data.xml.node.Element

- clojure.data.xml.node/element
  - takes 1, 2, 3 or 3+ args.
    - not variable arity
    - but looks like one

- parse-str
  - actually kw-args
